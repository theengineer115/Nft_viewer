# NFT Viewer Application

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a feature of a Proof of Concept (POC) developed for a client.

- **NFT Data Retrieval**: The application interacts with the Ethereum blockchain to fetch NFT data associated with the provided Ethereum address.
- **Display Ownership**: For each NFT, the application displays the Token ID and owner address.
